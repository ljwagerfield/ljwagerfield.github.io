## Optimise quantitative verification

-   Use continuous deployment to roll-out daily changes for immediate feedback.

-   Write automated tests to *prevent* functional defects.

-   Write automated triggers against business metrics to *detect* non-functional defects.

-   Use feature-switching to enable automated disabling of defective features.
