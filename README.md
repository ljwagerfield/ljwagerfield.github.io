# Lean Startup - Notes

Personal notes on managing a 'lean startup'. This content is largely derived from the works of:

-   The Lean Startup (E. Ries, 2011)

-   Running Lean (A. Maurya, 2012)

-   The Four Steps to the Epiphany (S. Blank, 2005)

These notes are best viewed as rendered HTML, [available on my GitHub Page](http://ljwagerfield.github.io/).
