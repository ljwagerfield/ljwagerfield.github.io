# Customer Validation

>   Encompasses the "Build-Measure-Learn" feedback loop

## Overview

>   Verify quantitatively

1.  Assume market quantitatively

2.  Assume solution quantitatively

3.  Build MVP

4.  Solution interviews (customer feedback)

5.  Steer

    1.  Pivot (strong negative signal - users say feature is wrong)

        -   Evolve *product hypothesis*. Return to step 2.

        -   Evolve *customer hypothesis*. Return to [customer discovery](customer-discovery.md).

    2.  Persevere (positive or mixed signals)

        -   Continue to step 6.

6.  Broader quantitative verification (split testing).

7.  Steer

    1.  Exit (satisfactory metric)

        -   Take next riskiest hypothesis.

        -   Return to step 2.

    2.  Pivot (marginal-or-negative impact)

        -   As per step 5-1.

    3.  Persevere (positive impact)

        -   Optimise the feature.

        -   Return to step 2.

## Step 1: Assume market quantitatively

>   Customers are the universal high-level success metric

-   Estimate market size. Conversion rates apply to this finite pool.

-   Define a target: % of market you wish to capture (retained customers).

## Step 2: Assume solution quantitatively

>   Focus on systems not goals

-   Conversion rates against discrete events.

    -   Actionable metrics tie performance to a specific repeatable action.

    -   Vanity metrics, by contrast, do not highlight a specific area for improvement.

-   Define a target: a value the metric must meet to sustain the business.

-   First iteration creates a baseline.

-   Data must be analysed in cohorts.

    -   Users who experience the same product journey.

    -   Removes other variables that skew metrics.

## Step 3: Build MVP

>   Is it possible to learn the same things with less effort?

-   Test the riskiest assumptions first.

    -   Acceptable to build separate MVPs aimed at getting feedback on individual assumptions.

-   Delay prevents startups from getting the feedback they need. 

-   Just enough for customer to visualise solution.

## Step 4: Solution interviews

>   No matter what comes of testing the MVP, you will not give up hope.

-   Prepare for the fact that MVPs often result in bad news.

-   Validate qualitatively as per problem interviews.

    -   Qualitative analysis gives direction and explains *why*, but is not a proof.

-   Verify quantitatively using predefine actionable metrics.

    -   Collect conversion rates during interviews.

    -   If customer does not give expected response: *stop and probe for more*.

        -   Switch to the *problem interview* script.

    -   Quantitative analysis *proves* performance, but cannot explain why.

## Step 6: Broader Quantitative Verification

>   If you have a lot of uncertainty now, you don't need much data to reduce uncertainty significantly. When you have a lot of certainty already, then you need a lot of data to reduce uncertainty significantly

-   Only when the majority of users have not already been tested as part of step 4.

-   A/B testing to eliminate other variables (including time).

-   Controversial: skip this step if a strong positive signal is received in step 4.

## Steps 5 + 7: Steer

>   Tune the engine from the baseline toward the ideal. This may take many attempts.

-   Pivot by changing a hypothesis:

    -   First change one of the *product hypotheses*:

        -   Features

        -   Benefits

        -   Dependencies

        -   Intellectual property (are we infringing, or are the NDAs slowing us down?)

    -   After exhausting the *product hypotheses*, pivot one of the *customer hypotheses*:

        -   Customer segments

        -   Customer problems

        -   Customer lifestyle: how much opportunity is there for a solution?

        -   Customer types: chain of people influencing the conversion.

        -   Return to [customer discovery](customer-discovery.md).

            -   Can occur when the problems you identified have too much friction for a solution.

-   Persevere by optimising the feature - but avoid a 'local maxima':

    -   Pick bold outcomes instead of chasing incremental improvements.

    -   E.g. rather than changing the colour of a button, change the entire page.

-   **You are done when** you have a sustainable business model.

    -   Proven through quantitative metrics.

    -   Customers are buying the solution.

    -   Customers see value (they are being retained).

    -   There is a sustainable Engine of Growth.
