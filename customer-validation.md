# Customer Validation

## Overview

>   Verify Quantitatively

1.  Assume market quantitatively

2.  Assume solution quantitatively

3.  Build MVP

4.  Solution interviews (customer feedback)

5.  Steer

    1.  Pivot (strong negative signal - users say feature is wrong)

        -   Evolve *product hypothesis*. Return to step 2.

        -   Evolve *customer hypothesis*. Return to [customer discovery](customer-discovery.md).

    2.  Persevere (positive or mixed signals)

        -   Continue to step 6.

6.  Broader quantitative verification (split testing).

7.  Steer

    1.  Exit (satisfactory metric)

        -   Take next riskiest hypothesis.

        -   Return to step 2.

    2.  Pivot (marginal-or-negative impact)

        -   As per step 5-1.

    3.  Persevere (positive impact)

        -   Optimise the feature.

        -   Return to step 2.

## Step 1: Assume market quantitatively

-   Estimate market size.

    -   Conversion rates apply to this finite pool.

    -   Indicates when a customer segment pivot is required.

-   Define a target: % of market you wish to capture.

    -   These are retained customers.   

    -   The 'universal high-level success metric'.  

## Step 2: Assume solution quantitatively

-   Conversion rates against discrete events.

    -   Actionable metrics tie performance to a specific repeatable action.

    -   Vanity metrics, by contrast, do not highlight a specific area for improvement.

-   Define a target: a value the metric must meet to sustain the business.

-   Data must be analysed in cohorts.

    -   Users who experience the same product journey.

    -   Removes other variables that skew metrics.

## Step 3: Build MVP

-   Delay prevents startups from getting the feedback they need. 

-   Just enough for customer to visualise solution.

## Step 4: Solution interviews

-   Validate qualitatively as per problem interviews.

    -   Qualitative analysis gives direction and explains *why*, but is not a proof.

    -   Set clear falsifiable hypotheses.

        -   Set targets too.

        -   If customer does not give expected response: *stop and probe for more*.

-   Verify quantitatively using predefine actionable metrics.

    -   Collect conversion rates during interviews.

    -   Quantitative analysis *proves* performance, but cannot explain why.

## Step 5: Steer

-   Pivoting involves changing one of the *product hypotheses*:

    -   Features

    -   Benefits

    -   Dependencies

    -   Intellectual property (are we infringing, or are the NDAs slowing us down?)

-   If the product hypothesis has been exhaustively pivoted:

    -   Pivot the *customer hypothesis*.

    -   Return to [customer discovery](customer-discovery.md).

    -   This can occur when the problems you identified have too much friction for a solution.

## Step 6: Broader Quantitative Verification

>   If you have a lot of uncertainty now, you don't need much data to reduce uncertainty significantly. When you have a lot of certainty already, then you need a lot of data to reduce uncertainty significantly

-   Only when the majority of users have not already been tested as part of step 4.

-   A/B testing to eliminate other variables (including time).

-   Controversial: skip this step if a strong positive signal is received in step 4.

## Step 7: Steer

-   Pivot as per 'step 5'.

-   Persevere by optimising the feature - but avoid a 'local maxima':

    -   Pick bold outcomes instead of chasing incremental improvements.

    -   E.g. rather than changing the colour of a button, change the entire page.

-   **You are done when** you have a sustainable business model.

    -   Proven through quantitative metrics.

    -   Customers are buying the solution.

    -   Customers see value (they are being retained).

    -   There is a sustainable Engine of Growth.
