>   Validate Qualitatively

1.  Envision

2.  Strategize

3.  Market research (broad, qualitative)

4.  Adviser feedback

5.  Problem interviews (customer feedback)

6.  Steer

    1.  Exit (positive signal)

        -   Begin [customer validation](customer-validation.md).

    2.  Pivot (negative signal)

        -   Envision new *customer hypothesis* to remedy failed part of business model.

        -   Return to step 2.

    3.  Persevere (mixed signals)

        -   New canvas for each interested niche.

        -   Revise assumptions based on learning.

        -   Hone-in on next riskiest assumptions.

        -   Return to step 4.

## Step 1: Envision

>   Don't lose sight of the forest for the trees.

-   Distil your *vision* in a single sentence.

    -   Why would someone go to your product first?

    -   Not a sales-pitch; an articulation of 'the thought you had in the shower'.

    -   If this is a multi-sided business, write a sentence for each side.

    -   Should be high-level and not constrained to a specific problem.

    -   Must allow room to explore multiple *strategies*.

-   The vision succinctly defines the market (even if it doesn't yet exist). 

    -   Allows you to assert who is in, adjacent to, or outside of your market.

    -   Think of the market as a castle. You want to invade it.

    -   You define strategies (*lean canvases*) for how to break through.

    -   Learn the weakest part in the castle's defence: the easiest route to market.

## Step 2: Strategize

>   Job to be done -> Problems -> Solutions

-   Discover problems that are solved in your vision:

    -   Cast a wide net to avoid a local-maxima problem.

    -   Brainstorm *jobs-to-be-done* that arise in your life that could be solved with this vision.

    -   Jobs-to-be-done identify core tasks someone tries to achieve in their life.

    -   *Problems* are what people face in their current environment when trying to achieve them.

    -   These can be solved by *solutions*, which will dictate how your vision materializes.

    -   *One way* to find jobs to be done is to look at existing solutions and then ask what people were trying to do initially.

-   Document each set of related problems as separate lean canvases:

    -   Under 20 minutes for each initial draft.

    -   Canvases are organic documents that evolve.

    -   Invaluable tool for articulating strategies to advisers.

## Step 3: Market Research

>   The market is a superset of your customers - ["market type is everything"](http://steveblank.com/2009/09/10/customer-development-manifesto-part-4/)

-   Continuous qualitative process.

-   Attempt to invalidate 'problem hypotheses' in your strategies by finding existing solutions.

    -   Ask other people if they are aware of existing solutions for these *problems*.

    -   Document each company that solves these problems.

    -   Categorise them by which market they occupy.

-   If you find competitors (companies that solve your problems *and* occupy the same market):

    -   Formulate a new strategy against a different customer segment / problem set.

    -   Return to step 2.

-   Market research clarifies your 'market type', which influences how you approach the market.

    -   New market. No established competition. Customer needs educating.

    -   Existing market. Established competition. Customer understood. Product must be better.

    -   Resegmented existing market, dividing by price.

    -   Resegmented existing market, dividing by niche customers/problems.

## Step 4: Adviser Feedback

>   The riskiest part of running a startup is not correctly identifying what's riskiest.

-   Find advisers.

    -   Continuous process.

    -   Should ideally have first adviser as early as possible.

    -   Unlike early adopters, they are not interested in a specific problem.

    -   Should be experienced entrepreneurs / heads of departments.

        -   Must have reputation.

        -   Advisers provide credibility.

        -   Must have enough time for you.

    -   Should fill a skills gap. I.e. do you need a seasoned CTO or VP of sales?

    -   Must have a passion for the industry.

    -   Advisers must be genuinely passionate.

        -   Equity should be offered to ensure they have a vested interest.

        -   Equity should be in single digits.

        -   Must not be their sole motivation.

        -   Should be offered as compensation, not negotiated as a deal.

-   Show advisers the canvas(es). Ask them:

    -   What do they consider to be the riskiest aspect of this plan?

    -   Have they overcome similar risks? How? 

    -   How would they go about testing these risks?

    -   Are there other people we should speak with?

## Step 5: Problem Interviews

>   Customer and market risks are higher than product risks

-   Find customers.

    -   Find customers using existing solutions.

        -   They express an active need for a solution.

        -   More likely to become early adopters.

        -   Prioritise channels you will actually use to acquire future customers.

    -   Also run a broader sweep.

        -   Avoid a local-maxima problem.

        -   Some of these may be unexpected early adopters.

        -   Use mTurk to have interviewees call you.

-   Never pitch solution: just learn the problems.

    -   Test riskiest assumptions first: validate the biggest problems you assume they have.

    -   Provides direction and explains *why*, but is not a proof.

-   Use same interview script for entire batch.

-   Never outsource learning.

-   Initially:

    -   Typically doesn't require a large sample size. 

    -   As few as 5 customer interviews.

-   And then:

    -   Prepare to interview 30 to 60 people over a 4 to 6 week period.

    -   Two or three customers a day.

-   Adjust the script and customer demographic

    -   Aim for stronger and more consistent positive signals with each subsequent batch

-   When talking with customers, learn about:

    -   Industry events. Attend these. Talk to speakers.

    -   Competitors. Investigate these. Do they affect our strategy?

    -   Consortiums and groups. Create a presence with these.

## Step 6: Steer

-   Goal is to get a strong signal, positive or negative.

-   Pivoting involves changing one the *customer hypotheses*:

    -   Customer segments

    -   Customer problems

    -   Customer lifestyle: how much opportunity is there for a solution?

    -   Customer types: chain of people influencing the conversion.

-   **You are done when:**

    -   You stop learning anything new from the interviews.

    -   You have identified one or more niche customer segments

    -   These niches are abundant with early adopters.
