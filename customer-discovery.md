    1.  Exit (positive signal)

        -   Begin [customer validation](customer-validation.md).

    2.  Pivot (negative signal)

        -   Envision new *customer hypothesis* to remedy failed part of business model.

        -   Return to step 1.

    3.  Persevere (mixed signals)

        -   New canvas for each interested niche.

        -   Revise assumptions based on learning.

        -   Hone-in on next riskiest assumptions.

        -   Return to step 3.

## Step 1: Envision

>   It takes an average of 58 ideas to deliver a single successful new product.

-   Constrain your idea around a domain you are passionate about.

-   Cast a wide net to avoid a local-maxima problem.

    -   Different problems.

    -   Different markets.

-   Produce canvas(es).

    -   Initially may be 1.

    -   New canvas for each problem domain.

    -   Under 20 minutes for each initial draft.

    -   Avoid deep analysis at this stage - *initial assumptions are often disproved*

        -   Just enough to articulate idea to advisers.

        -   Identifies a starting point for problem interviews.

>   Too many business plans look like they are planning to launch a rocket than drive a car. 

-   Produce a high-concept pitch: a single line to express the idea.

-   Identify market type (new, existing, re-segment niche/price).

    -   Affects how you approach customers.

-   The canvas is an organic document that evolves.

-   An overarching 'vision' canvas may not exist in reality; it exists as the union of all derivative canvases.

### Step 2: Market Research

>   The market is a superset of your customers. It must be understood.

-   Broader knowledge of the market will highlight:

    -   Validity of your 'market type' assumption: new, existing, re-segment niche/price.

    -   New search spaces for formulating hypotheses.

    -   Analogues to alleviate testing.

-   Share your idea with friends: they often know parts of the market you are not aware of.

-   When talking with customers, learn about:

    -   Industry events. Attend these. Talk to speakers.

    -   Competitors. Investigate these. Do they affect our market type hypothesis?

    -   Consortiums and groups. Create a presence with these.

## Step 3: Adviser Feedback

>   The riskiest part of running a startup is not correctly identifying what's riskiest.

-   Find advisers.

    -   Continuous process.

    -   Should ideally have first adviser as early as possible.

    -   Unlike early adopters, they are not interested in a specific problem.

    -   Should be experienced entrepreneurs / heads of departments.

        -   Must have reputation.

        -   Advisers provide credibility.

        -   Must have enough time for you.

    -   Should fill a skills gap. I.e. do you need a seasoned CTO or VP of sales?

    -   Must have a passion for the industry.

    -   Advisers must be genuinely passionate.

        -   Equity should be offered to ensure they have a vested interest.

        -   Equity should be in single digits.

        -   Must not be their sole motivation.

        -   Should be offered as compensation, not negotiated as a deal.

-   Show advisers the canvas(es). Ask them:

    -   What do they consider to be the riskiest aspect of this plan?

    -   Have they overcome similar risks? How? 

    -   How would they go about testing these risks?

    -   Are there other people we should speak with?

## Step 4: Problem Interviews

>   Customer and market risks are higher than product risks

-   Find customers.

    -   Find customers using existing solutions.

        -   They express an active need for a solution.

        -   More likely to become early adopters.

        -   Prioritise channels you will actually use to acquire future customers.

    -   Also run a broader sweep.

        -   Avoid a local-maxima problem.

        -   Some of these may be unexpected early adopters.

        -   Use mTurk to have interviewees call you.

-   Never pitch solution: just learn the problems.

    -   Test riskiest assumptions first: validate the biggest problems you assume they have.

    -   Provides direction and explains *why*, but is not a proof.

-   Use same interview script for entire batch.

-   Never outsource learning.

-   Initially:

    -   Typically doesn't require a large sample size. 

    -   As few as 5 customer interviews.

-   And then:

    -   Prepare to interview 30 to 60 people over a 4 to 6 week period.

    -   Two or three customers a day.

-   Adjust the script and customer demographic

    -   Aim for stronger and more consistent positive signals with each subsequent batch

## Step 5: Steer

-   Goal is to get a strong signal, positive or negative.

-   Pivoting involves changing one the *customer hypotheses*:

    -   Customer segments

    -   Customer problems

    -   Customer lifestyle: how much opportunity is there for a solution?

    -   Customer types: chain of people influencing the conversion.

-   **You are done when:**

    -   You stop learning anything new from the interviews.

    -   You have identified one or more niche customer segments

    -   These niches are abundant with early adopters.
