# Running Lean

>   Customers are the universal high-level success metric. 

>   Pace growth by increasing each batch by x10 until you hit your estimated scale.

## Problem / Solution Fit

>   Do I have a problem worth solving?

Prerequisite: vision. 

Prove: desirability (acquisition + activation); viability (revenue); feasibility (can it be built). 

-   Perform [customer discovery](customer-discovery.md) followed by [customer validation](customer-validation.md). This process is iterative.

-   MVPs should be demos at this stage.

-   Initial indications of problem/solution fit within 8 - 12 weeks.

    -   First paying customers.

    -   If a reset is required, it should be obvious at this stage.

-   Final indication of problem/solution fit is an 80% end-to-end conversion rate from early adopters.

## Product / Market Fit

>   Have I built something people want?

Prerequisite: MVP. 

Prove: value (retention).

-   Continue customer [discovery](customer-discovery.md) and [validation](customer-validation.md).

-   Prove repeatability by targeting additional customer segment niches.

-   Tune the MVP, reaching a business model that works for each.

-   MVP becomes a releasable product.

## Scale

>   How do I accelerate growth?

Prerequisite: valued product. 

Prove: growth (metrics depend on EoG).

-   Look for investment before scaling (once proving product/market fit).
